        <p class="paragraph-margins">Cameron Jerell Newton is widely regarded as the greatest quarterback to play for the Carolina Panthers. His most notable achievements include wininng the Heisman Trophy in 2010, being picked first overall by the Panthers in 2011, leading his team to a 15-1 season and a Super Bowl appearance in the 2015-16 season, and winning the NFL MVP in 2015. While he has been a very succesful quarterback for the Carolina Panthers, this success was short-lived as he faced many injuries in the 2018 and 2019 seasons. Though his injuries harmed his ability to play at the same level as he was playing earlier in his career, his achievements during his time in Carolina cemented him as a Carolina Panthers legend.</p>
